                    <p>My name is Laura Casey and, although I was born in southern New Jersey, I am proud to call the south my home. I live in Charlotte, NC with my amazing fiance, Tyler, and our  adorable son, Charlie. The terrible two's have come but we manage to make it though with a whole lot of love and patience. I am so lucky to have their support every day. </p>
                   
                   <br>

                    <p> I have been interested in making the jump to web devlopment ever since my first job out of college. As an IT Recruiter I got to talk to many people, in many areas of technology, about their day-to-day work and the pojects they were currently working on and interested in pursuing. Their jobs always sounded so much more fascinating to me than what I was doing! I figured, with a B.A. in Philosophy, making the jump to IT would be hard. Not so! While coding is complicated, I have founbd it a joy to learn and it has been so exciting to see my work come to life.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p> I am most excited about learning Java, PHP, MySQL, NoSQL, and some of the technologies that I was looking to fill roles for daily as a recruiter. As of right now just exploring the boundaries of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been amazing. Although I feel it is impossile to have a complete understanding of any language, I can now say that I am confident in utilizing them!</p>

                    <br>

                    <p> Thank you for visiting my page and following me on my journey into web development. I am excited to be able to share this experience with you all.</p>
